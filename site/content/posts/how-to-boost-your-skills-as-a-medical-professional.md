Physicians and nurses are vital for keeping our healthcare system functioning, and as a result many people rely on them every day for their healthcare needs. Becoming a medical professional requires rigorous training over a period of years too, and that’s a hallmark of quality that patients and colleagues can trust. But how do physicians and others [learn](https://minoritynurse.com/category/nursing-careers/) about the latest advances in medical technology, for example, or the outcomes of major pieces of research? This article will explore the role of [Continuing Medical Education](https://www.boardvitals.com) (CME) in the professional development of physicians, and look at how people in this profession can continue to develop even long after their college program or [residency](https://www.aamc.org/cim/residency/) have come to an end. **Benefits of CME** College programs in medicine and nursing are thorough and comprehensive, and in theory they cover all that a medical professional needs to know in order to practice safely and thoroughly. But the medical profession is an ever-evolving field, and as a result there is a lot of new information which is useful for nurses and physicians to know coming out almost every day. The outcomes of research papers is one example, while the development of new practices and modes of treatment is another. **CME options** Depending on the precise CME provider you choose, you’ll find that there’s some variation and that the exact content can differ slightly. But most CME organizations focus on the same sorts of areas. Often, for example, there’ll be a topic cluster which matches your specialty, including everything from internal and emergency medicine to nursing-specific subjects like pharmacology, critical care nursing and more. **Formats and teaching methods** As anyone who has ever worked in - or even visited - a hospital or other medical environment will know, professionals who work in these places often have large to-do lists to complete on a daily basis. That means any continuing medical education will need to be slotted in around the many ongoing professional responsibilities which need to be carried out. That’s why most reputable CME providers offer the chance to learn in a variety of convenient ways, such as via a portable device like a tablet or smartphone. And by emphasizing rigorous teaching methods such as board-quality questions and practical use cases, the CME you receive from many top providers will stand you in good stead no matter what direction your career goes in next. Studying to be a nurse or a physician is something that, quite rightly, takes a long time to complete. But while the focus is often on the early qualifications, such as college degrees and residency programs, it’s also the case that many people in these professions continue to develop and grow as practitioners long after their formal education has ended. So, whether you’re a physician looking to learn about new research on the go or a nurse seeking to top up your pharmaceutical knowledge in between shifts, CME is definitely an avenue you should consider.
