If you’re nervous about visiting the dentist or having a dental procedure performed, it may be worthwhile looking into sleep dentistry. Going to sleep during a dental procedure can help make the process much less stressful, as you won’t feel physically uncomfortable. In addition, a dentist can complete dental cleaning and other procedures much faster when the patient is sedated. There are a number of sedative types that can be offered by a sleep dentist, including:

*   General anaesthesia – Primarily used for minor dental surgery
*   Nitrous oxide – A gas used to relax a dental patient
*   Oral medication – Often combined with other anaesthetics
*   Intravenous sedation – Useful for longer dental surgeries

Here are some of the benefits of undergoing sedation when you visit the dentist for an examination, dental cleaning or surgical procedure. 

**Benefit 1: Ensuring You Have Routine Dental Care** 

 When you’re too anxious to visit the dentist for routine examinations and cleanings, your dental health will suffer – and poor dental health can also affect other areas of your body. If the only way that you can visit a dentist is by having sedation, then it’s recommended you find a [sleep dentist](http://www.ebdg.com.au/dental-services/sleep-dentistry/) who can provide this service. With regular checkups, a dentist can find and remedy small problems early on before they cause a major infection or extensive dental decay. 

 **Benefit 2: Relieving Your Stress** 

 When you receive nitrous oxide, general anaesthesia or another type of sedative, you’ll feel completely relaxed and free of stress. If your body becomes tense or if you feel nauseated when going to the dentist, requesting sedation dentistry could be the best option. Make sure to speak to your dentist before you arrive for your appointment so that they can have the best type of sedative ready for you. A sleep dentist may need to communicate with your GP to determine if you have any health issues that require the use of a particular sedative. 

 **Benefit 3: Relaxing Your Body** 

 If you experience muscle tension or respiratory distress when thinking about visiting the dentist, you could benefit from taking oral sedatives beforehand. By the time you get into the dental chair, your muscles will be relaxed, making it easier for the dentist to examine your mouth. With less muscle tension, you can open your mouth more easily and the dentist can examine your teeth and gums faster. In addition, after the examination ends, you’re less likely to have a stiff neck and sore jaw.

  **Benefit 4: Less Pain During and After the Procedure**

   When you experience anxiety at the dentist, your body produces more adrenaline that can make you feel more pain. With sleep dentistry, you’ll have less fear, resulting in less adrenaline. This means that you’ll experience reduced pain during and after the procedure. 

   **How Do You Find a Sleep Dentist?** 

   If you’re looking to find a sleep dentist, it’s important to read a dentist's website or call their office to find out about the types of sedation they offer. Some dentists avoid using sleep dentistry unless absolutely necessary to prevent pain, while other dentists understand that some patients require sedation to relieve intense anxiety. It is worth mentioning that technology is currently having a positive impact on dentistry.
