Approximately 30 million men in the United States suffer from erectile dysfunction, but it is often not recognized as a serious medical condition. 

As part of its ongoing research efforts to assess the impact of erectile dysfunction, the _ED Treatment Information Center_ has launched a new online survey targeting the partners of men suffering from ED.  The survey takes about 5 minutes to complete, and is completely anonymous. 

To participate in the survey, visit: 

https://edtreatment.info/launching-a-survey-for-partner-of-men-with-ed/ A previous study by the Center, which was published in March 2018, surveyed 597 men suffering from ED. The survey responses show that ED has a profound negative impact on men’s lives and relationships, including their confidence, self-esteem, and general happiness. 

An astounding 87.1% of men said that ED had “Some Impact” or a “Major Impact” on their self-esteem, and 88.0% said that ED had “Some Impact” or a “Major Impact” on their relationship with their spouse or partner. 

The survey also shows that, because of feelings of embarrassment and shame, men are often uncomfortable talking about their condition.  40.2% are not comfortable talking to a doctor, and 48.2% are not comfortable talking to their spouse or partner.  This prevents men from getting the support and help they need, and contributes to feelings of isolation and depression. 

Men also reported dissatisfaction with their doctors (70.8%) and counselors (78.8%), and with every treatment method tried.

The Center’s website, [EDtreatment.info](https://edtreatment.info), posts authoritative information on the causes and treatment of erectile dysfunction. The site includes references and citations to clinical research to support its conclusions and recommendations.
