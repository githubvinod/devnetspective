SE Healthcare has [announced](https://www.healthcareguys.com/2018/06/13/new-software-platform-helps-practices-increase-revenue-through-enhanced-reimbursement/) the official rollout of its software platform that would help practices increase revenue through enhanced reimbursement. For this exciting news, we decided to interview [Brian Donovan](https://www.sehealthcarequalityconsulting.com/brian-k-donovan/), VP of Business Development at [SE Healthcare](https://www.sehealthcarequalityconsulting.com/).

 **SE Healthcare has added a new component to the company’s Physician Empowerment Suite, namely, the Reimbursement Effectiveness Platform. Can you tell us more about this platform?** 

[The Reimbursement Effectiveness Platform (RE)](https://www.sehealthcarequalityconsulting.com/solutions/the-reimbursement-effectiveness-platform/) is a component of [the Physician Empowerment Suite™ (PES)](https://www.sehealthcarequalityconsulting.com/solutions/physician-empowerment-suite/). The PES is a set of data analytics tools that help practices and healthcare organizations of all sizes to enhance operational performance, mitigate risk, improve reputation, and optimize reimbursement.

 The RE tool uses [Patient Experience](https://www.sehealthcarequalityconsulting.com/solutions/the-patient-experience-platform/) and [Clinical Effectiveness](https://www.sehealthcarequalityconsulting.com/solutions/the-clinical-effectiveness-platform/) data from within the Physician Empowerment Suite™ to develop a “value story” for a practice. It also develops an analysis of payment levels for a practice’s top commercial payers. With this information, a practice becomes well-positioned to drive performance within the practice and engage payers for enhanced fee-for-service and fee-for-value reimbursements. 

 The RE Platform also provides a library of instructional videos which walk users through a variety of topics. The video library covers topics like:

*   The changing landscape of healthcare
*   The steps to better leverage for negotiation with payers
*   Elements of value-based pay
*   How to prepare a Payer Portfolio Analysis and use it to negotiate with payers
*   Expert knowledge on reimbursement topics
*   How to optimize use of the Physician Empowerment Suite (PES)

**How can the Reimbursement Effectiveness Platform complement the other components of the Physician Empowerment Suite?** 

 As mentioned previously, the RE tool uses Patient Experience and Clinical Effectiveness data to develop a “value story” for a practice.  This report helps quantify a healthcare provider’s value to key stakeholders in the market based on various aspects of patient care and practice operations. A report is automatically developed that highlights areas where the organization thrives or needs improvement and shares other supporting performance data. 

 **How can the Reimbursement Effectiveness Platform help healthcare providers increase reimbursement and grow their business?**

  The Payer Portfolio Analysis, another component of the Reimbursement Effectiveness Platform, is a benchmarking analysis tool that displays payment rates for top commercial payers compared to Medicare and other sources. By highlighting where practices are underpaid, they can create a fee-for-service, payer-specific strategy for top commercial payers. Together with the value story, practices can use this information to drive performance within their practice and engage payers for enhanced fee-for-service and fee-for-value reimbursements. 

  **What types of reimbursements can the Reimbursement Effectiveness Platform handle?**

   Fee-for-Service, but by leveraging the value story component of the tool, the practice becomes well-positioned to explore opportunities for entering into enhanced fee-for-value arrangements. This creates possible new revenue streams. 

   **Who can use and benefit from the Reimbursement Effectiveness Platform?** 

   All healthcare providers who have fee for service agreements with payers including hospitals, physician practices, and ancillary providers.
