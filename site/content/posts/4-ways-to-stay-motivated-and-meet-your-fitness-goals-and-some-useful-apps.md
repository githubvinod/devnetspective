You've already set your fitness goals and started an exercise routine — but you struggle with motivation. Some mornings, you can think of a dozen different reasons to skip your workout, and staying in bed sounds like a much better option. If that sounds like you, give one of the following tips a try: 

**Get Someone Else Involved** 

One of the easiest ways to stay motivated is to get someone else involved. For instance, you could ask a friend to be your workout buddy, train for a 5K with your significant other, or join a support group on Facebook. This helps in at least two ways. First, telling someone else about your fitness goals means that if you fail, someone besides you will notice. That accountability factor alone can be enough to keep you in line. Second, your fitness partner(s) can offer the advice and encouragement you need to keep going. 

**Put Your Money Where Your Goals Are** 

If you find yourself consistently making choices based on what's cheaper rather than what's healthier, then you might want to consider investing money in your fitness goals. You could join a gym or enroll in an exercise class. Knowing that you paid for these things may motivate you to take them more seriously so that your money doesn't go to waste. After all, the more often you go to the gym, the better deal you're getting on that annual membership. Similarly, you may find yourself more likely to attend a class you've already paid for. For even better results, convince a friend or family member to tag along. You'll have a little extra motivation to make good on your investment, and good company will make exercising more enjoyable. Not only will you both reap all the benefits of a group fitness class, but you may even find yourself looking forward to going! 

**Track Your Progress** 

Another way to keep yourself motivated is to keep track of your progress. This can be done on paper if you like, but [fitness trackers](https://lifesum.com/health-education/how-fitness-trackers-can-boost-our-motivation) can provide even more motivation. Many fitness tracking apps allow you to keep track of calories, weight loss, water consumption, [macro nutrients](https://healthyeater.com/counting-macros), workouts, and more. They may even offer additional insight, such as how well you're meeting daily nutritional recommendations or what you would weigh in five weeks if every day were like today. 

**Look for Ways to Have Fun** 

As you look for ways to be more active, don't forget to have fun! If your only experience with exercise has been dutifully powering through a high-intensity workout DVD or running a couple of miles on a treadmill each day, you shouldn't be surprised that you hate exercising. Shake things up a little by adding a few activities you actually enjoy to your workout rotation. If you choose well, you can burn calories [without even feeling like you're exercising](https://www.nerdfitness.com/blog/25-ways-to-exercise-without-realizing-it/). No two people are exactly alike, so it makes sense that not everyone is motivated by the same things. The key is knowing yourself. If one motivational tool doesn't work, try another — and keep trying until you find what works for you. A little trial and error is a small price to pay for a healthier you. 

**Useful Apps**
