Cambridge, MA - Over 100 health professionals will convene on Saturday, March 31, 2018 in a national conference organized by American Muslim Health Professionals (AMHP) and the Cambridge Public Health Department. The objective of the conference is to foster dialogue and leverage the skills and talents of Muslim professionals from diverse sectors across AMHP’s core areas of focus: mental health; advocacy and advancing access to health care; and career and professional development.“We are thrilled to host over 20 inspiring leaders in health care at this year’s conference,” said Faseeha Altaf, AMHP President. “These individuals are leaders in their fields and their collective wisdom will help participants think about how we can tackle public health challenges in our communities through innovation and collaboration.” Confirmed speakers include Dr. Joan Reede, Dean of Diversity and Community Partnership at Harvard Medical School, Amy Rosenthal, Executive Director of Healthcare for All, Dr. Wasif Syed, Founder and CEO of Ivy Strategy Advisor LLC_ and Dr. Vikram Patel, the Pershing Square Professor of Global Health at Harvard Medical School.

According to Kashif Mian, AMHP Vice President and Conference Chair, “This inaugural national conference leverages AMHP's expertise and credibility in healthcare advocacy, mental health, and civic awareness, by providing a platform for industry experts, researchers, clinicians, healthcare entrepreneurs and public health pioneers to come together and interact with a star studded roster of highly renowned and respected speakers." 

The conference is open to all health professionals and anyone interested in improving the health of Americans.
