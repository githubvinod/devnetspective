Nowadays, a large number of families with children live with a hectic daily schedule of activities, appointments, and commitments. This type of lifestyle ensures that not only will it be difficult to sit down as a family to a healthy homemade dinner, but that the family’s meals are likely to be comprised of a considerable amount of take-out and frozen, prepackaged meals. It's not a great surprise that these diets are typically unhealthy and may very well adversely impact your child’s health and wellness. Some poor early eating habits extend into adulthood and might even evolve into long-term illnesses. **What Every Parent Already Knows** As parents, we know that eating well has a myriad of benefits for our children. A healthy diet and nutritious meal plan will improve your child’s mind and energy, even out their moods, help to stabilize and maintain a healthy weight and prevent the early onset of some health conditions such as heart disease, type 2 diabetes, and high blood pressure. No two children are exactly alike so, as parents, to believe that each of our children will act and eat the same is just wrong. **When Life Throws You a Curve** When a family has a child with a specific medical disorder, the importance of a healthy diet increases ten-fold. Conditions such as dysphagia cause a person to have difficulty swallowing. Thankfully there are products such as [SimplyThick](https://simplythicknectar.com/), a liquid thickener that when added to a watery food makes it easier to ingest. Just as important as being able to get nutritious meals into our children is what is in those meals. This is especially relevant when one of our children is living with a medical condition. **Nutritious Meals Feed The Whole Child** Any child living off a diet of processed foods, full of sugar and empty of nutrients, is bound to have difficulty learning and thriving. When a child suffers from anxiety, depression or even ADHD, they will have the added struggle of that disease with which to contend. Most parents will agree that it is easier to identify the physical needs of their children but find it much harder to understand mental health issues. Nutritious food is one area parents can provide for both the physical and psychological well-being of their kids. **Healthy Minds and Healthy Bodies** Eating well will not only reduce hunger but also has an incredible effect on mental health. A nutrient-rich daily diet which includes wholegrain cereals, vegetables and fruit will trigger and deliver the neurotransmitters dopamine together with serotonin, both of these contributing to the promotion of stable and happier moods. A great way to get your child interested in eating healthy foods is to do so yourself.
