In today’s hectic lifestyle, confidence is the only companion that can help a woman successfully deal with her everyday challenges and responsibilities. Confidence in a woman can come from various factors related to her personal achievements and skills. However, this same confidence can also get hampered by an unhealthy skin condition like [acne](https://www.aad.org/public/diseases/acne-and-rosacea/acne). 

Having blemish-free skin, on the other hand, does wonders to one’s confidence, at home and at work. This is called skin confidence. Skin confidence is basically the ease and comfort a person feels in their own skin, whether it is bare or covered with makeup.

 **Acne is the Culprit**

  Acne is the number one skin problem in the US According to Statistic Brain, 60 million Americans suffer from acne at any point in time and for 20 million of these people, the condition is bad enough to cause scars. It was also added that 85% of people have experienced acne at some point of their life. 

  According to the various reviews published by [Elite Dermatology in Katy](https://elitedermatology.com/), TX, most people experience the first appearance of acne during puberty. This condition is often the result of hormonal changes and body transformations taking place during adolescence. Even an adult who might have missed this traumatic teenage experience might suddenly be stricken with adult-onset acne, leaving their skin covered in unsightly pimples and blemishes. For anyone with acne, the marks and zits can become a source of embarrassment. 

  Fortunately, there are acne treatments available from the best dermatologists in Katy, TX, to help people struggling with acne. Here are a few ways you can prevent acne and boost skin confidence. 

  **3 Ways to Achieve Skin Confidence**

1.  **Proper Skin Care:** Your skin is a reflection of your health and should not be taken for granted. If you want to look young for long, make sure you cleanse tone and moisturize your skin on a daily basis, especially before you hit the bed at night. If you have acne, skip the moisturizer or consult a dermatologist for the right way to keep your skin hydrated.
2.  **Eat Right:** It is commonly said that you are what you eat. Whatever you choose to eat shows up on your face, sooner or later. Eating junk and fried food will make your skin age faster and increase the chances of acne. On the other hand, eating plenty of fruits and greens that are rich sources of Vitamins C and E, will keep your skin rejuvenated, radiant and attractive. Other than eating the right food, it is equally important to stay hydrated to achieve a clear skin, free from acne.
3.  **Exercise:** Stress is known to be a major contributor to acne Exercise helps to improve blood circulation and keep us stress free, which reduces the chances of acne. Moreover, when we exercise, we sweat. Sweating helps removes toxins from the body, _reducing_breakouts.

If all these things don’t work for you, there are acne treatments available at the best dermatological clinics in Katy. You can even find specialists in Dysport and Botox treatments in Katy, Texas, but make sure you check the dermatology reviews before choosing a clinic.
