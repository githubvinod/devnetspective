 **1\. Use the Latest Trauma Beating Technology** 

 There are hundreds of ways of dealing with trauma, but usually, only a handful will work for individuals. One of the most powerful ways to deal with trauma is exposure therapy. However, certain traumas are hard to be exposed to. For example, how do you “expose” a combat veteran to enough stimulation to help him get over having his best friend gunned down? How do you “expose” an assault victim to enough stimulation to help them get over the beating? 

 This is where technology comes in. 

 The rise of virtual reality and reality augmentation gear has created new ways of dealing with trauma. As NBC news reported, [veterans with severe PTSD showed significant improvement after just 30 days of exposure therapy in a virtual world](https://www.nbcnews.com/mach/innovation/how-virtual-reality-helping-heal-soldiers-ptsd-n733816). The treatment was extremely powerful because it gave veterans enough stimulation to relive the memories over and over but in a healing way rather than a damaging one. 

 Researches are still exploring the scope of virtual realities and their potential in dealing with trauma. If you have the resources and opportunity to try it out, begin with the latest technologies.
