Teens suffer high stress, and they need help to cope with it. The worst part is that they do not find many people to help them in coping with stress. This is because they are not willing to open up on this matter and get help. If you fall into this category and desperately need help, here are some tips that will help you [cope with stress](https://www.healthxchange.sg/wellness/mental-health/tips-cope-stress). **1\. Get some sleep** There are many things to do as a teenager and between homework, hanging out with friends and performing other activities; you need to find an excuse to get some sleep. It can be hard at times when you know you have some priorities and sleeping is not on the list. However, it is up to you, and you should decide whether fight stress or not. So, the first step is to make sure that you get enough sleep on a daily basis to wake up with a fresh mind. **2\. Engage in physical activities** Physical activity is a stress buster, and if you can include it in your routine, you'll be happy to fight stress and keep yourself at ease. There are many options available in this is such as walking, biking, skateboarding, hiking, and yoga. Choose an activity that keeps you entertained while you are fighting stress secretly. **3\. Avoid unnecessary medication** Medicines might be good for you if you are choosing something like Afobazol from [Pharmacer](https://pharmacer.com). However, in most of the cases, it will not be a great choice for you if you are dependent on it. Being dependent on medicines at a young age is not good for you, and so you should try your best to restrict your medicine intake. If it is necessary, go ahead with it. If it is not necessary, look for a reason to avoid it. **4\. Talk about it to someone** Whatever may be the situation, it will only get better for you if you talk about it to someone who can be your reliable partner. If you can trust them, it will only help you in relieving yourself while trying to make healthy choices and manage stress in the best possible way. In this case, even if there is a need for you to get in touch with a physiologist, don't back out because it is about your life. Teenagers often do not trust adults because they feel that an adult will not understand their problem. If this is the case, you can talk to her friend of yours who can be relied upon for topics that are troubling you. **5\.
