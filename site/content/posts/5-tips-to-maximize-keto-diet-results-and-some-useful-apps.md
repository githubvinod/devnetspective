It might end up doing more harm than good to your body. Always remember that even a Perfect KETO will not work miracles unless you are doing your best to ensure you achieve your goals at the end of the day. **So, what do I have to do right?** If you do not know what you need to do to maximize the results of your KETO diet, this article got you covered.
