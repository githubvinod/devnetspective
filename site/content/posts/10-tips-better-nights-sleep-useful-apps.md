When it comes to getting a better night sleep, the mattresses and pillow companies on television will fool you into thinking that those are the only things preventing you from sleeping through the night. But there are actually a lot of factors out there that affect your quality of sleep. Here are ten tips that will help you get a better night sleep, and some useful apps you can use to aid you in your sleep. 

**Make it Dark** 

The first tip is to make sure that you are in a dark environment when you’re trying to sleep. Your body goes into sleep mode when your eyes detect darkness. But if you have lights on, including televisions or mobile devices, you may be telling your body that it is not time to sleep, which might explain why it’s so difficult to drift off. 

**Get the Right Mattress** 

The mattress companies are not wrong. Having the right mattress [does make a difference](https://www.huffingtonpost.com/2014/02/09/mattress-sleep-health_n_4740435.html) in your quality of sleep. You will have to do your own research and determine which of the premium mattresses out there is right for you. 

**Get the Right Pillows** 

The same goes for getting the right pillows. If you are having trouble sleeping, changing your pillow may help. Of course, choosing a pillow these days is nearly as complicated as choosing a mattress. 

**Prepare for Bed** 

The next thing you can do is make sure that you’re prepared for bed. This means knowing what time you’re going to go to bed and winding down a couple of hours before that time comes along. You don’t want to exercise or do something that is going to get you excited right before bed. 

**Power down Electronics** 

If you turn off your electronic devices, you will be much less tempted to go and see who a message or an email is from when your phone goes off. Plus, those alerts are probably keeping you up. Power down your devices and let them be until morning. 

**Avoid Caffeine** 

You obviously want to [avoid caffeine](https://sleepfoundation.org/sleep-topics/caffeine-and-sleep) when you’re trying to turn in. Caffeine is a stimulant the raises your heart rate and blood pressure and makes you have difficulty sleeping, even if you are tired in the first place. 

**Create a Routine Sleep Cycle** 

If you can create a routine, your body will learn when your sleep cycle is and start to prepare for that sleep cycle automatically. But that means that you have to go to bed about the same time every night as well as get up around the same time. 

**Exercise Daily** 

You definitely want to exercise during the day. When you exercise, you are burning calories and ensuring that when you go to sleep that night you will have expended some energy. Just don’t exercise right before you go to bed, because raising your heart rate and blood pressure isn’t going to help you sleep. 

**Turn Down the Heat** 

One of the things that can sometimes make it hard to sleep is a high temperature. If you have your thermostat set to seventy-five, and you are covered up with a blanket, you are probably going to feel overheated. Consider lowering the thermostat or just covering up with a sheet. 

**Try a Sleep Mask** 

Finally, you should try [a luxury sleep mask](https://mantasleep.com/products/manta-sleep-mask). Not only are these incredibly comfortable, they also block out all of the light which is one of the key elements to getting a good night sleep. Unfortunately, not many people make use of this sleep aid, but those who use them know how beneficial they are for getting to sleep and staying asleep the entire night. 

**Useful apps** 

Technology is nearly touching every aspect of our lives, and sleep is no different. In this section, some useful apps that could aid you in sleep are presented.
